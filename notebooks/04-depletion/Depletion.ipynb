This is enabled by the `reduce()` method of the `Chain` class. Let's start with a full-blown depletion chain based on ENDF/B-VII.1 and then reduce it to a select set of nuclides for the sake of analyzing activation in nickel."

If your problem includes integral burnable absorbers, these typically require shorter time steps at or below 1 MWd/kgHM. These are typically valid for the predictor scheme, as the point of recent schemes is to extend this step size. A good convergence study, where the step size is decreased until some convergence metric is satisfied, is a beneficial exercise.\n",
